With `ether-rs` in Rust, you can perform a variety of tasks beyond token transfers. Here are some examples:

1. **Smart Contract Interaction**: You can interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes deploying contracts, calling contract methods, and listening to contract events.

2. **Account Management**: You can create, manage, and interact with Ethereum accounts. This includes generating new key pairs, managing wallet files, and handling account balances.

3. **Blockchain Queries**: You can query the blockchain for information such as block data, transaction details, and network status. This includes fetching the current block number, retrieving block details, and getting transaction receipts.

4. **Event Listening**: You can subscribe to and listen for various events on the blockchain, such as new blocks, pending transactions, and specific contract events. This is useful for building real-time applications that need to react to blockchain activity.

5. **Gas Estimation**: You can estimate the gas required for transactions and contract calls. This helps in ensuring that transactions have sufficient gas to be processed successfully.

6. **Transaction Management**: You can create, sign, and send custom transactions. This includes setting custom gas prices, nonces, and handling transaction receipts.

7. **Integration with Other Protocols**: You can integrate with various Ethereum-based protocols, such as DeFi applications, decentralized exchanges, and NFT platforms. This enables you to build complex applications that leverage the existing Ethereum ecosystem.

8. **Data Encoding and Decoding**: You can encode and decode data for smart contract interactions, such as ABI (Application Binary Interface) encoding/decoding. This is crucial for correctly formatting data when calling contract methods.

9. **Off-chain Computations**: You can perform off-chain computations and relay the results to the blockchain. This can be used for applications like oracles, where off-chain data needs to be provided to smart contracts.

By utilizing `ether-rs`, you can leverage Rust's performance and safety features to build robust and efficient blockchain applications that go beyond simple token transfers.
